# Simple Linear Regression

This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict an employee's salary based on their years of experience.

## âœ… Steps Performed
1. Imported required libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
2. Loaded and explored the dataset
3. Split the data into training and test sets
4. Trained a simple linear regression model using Scikit-learn
5. Visualized the training and test set results
6. Evaluated the model performance



## ðŸ“Š Output
- Scatter plot showing actual vs predicted salaries
- A straight line showing the regression fit
